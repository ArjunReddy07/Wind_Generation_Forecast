# Very short-term analysis of wind power generation in a probabilistic forecasting framework

## Introduction
This study aims to forecast the wind power generation in the very short-term, more precisely on 10-minute ahead. The main reason for 
focusing on wind energy is that it is one of the most volatile sources of energy.
The analysis is focused on a Spanish wind farm, which is the site of Galicia in the northwest region of Spain. In particular, this country 
is one of the European countries that use wind energy the most. It is the second European country in term of production. This aspect 
directly motivated the choice to focus on this site. 
All forecasts are associated with some sort of uncertainty and probabilistic forecasts are often preferred over deterministic forecast to 
better express this uncertainty. This is the reason why this study places us in a parametric probabilistic forecasting framework.
The way a probabilistic forecast represents uncertainty allows more nuanced decision-making.
The aim of a probabilistic forecast is to maximise the sharpness subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency 
between the probabilistic forecast and the observations, whereas sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions 
(Gneiting et al., 2007). If we declare an interval or event to have probability p, the forecast is calibrated if the event happens a 
proportion p of the time on average (Raftery et al., 2005). The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) combines both sharpness and 
calibration to evaluate the performance of a forecast. The score is minimized when the probabilistic forecast is identical to the 
distribution of the process we want to forecast, and is thus a proper scoring rule (Gneiting et al., 2007).
The main objective of this study is twofold. On the one hand, it is to extend the Pinson (2012) model by introducing a dynamic structure 
for the location of the wind generation. On the other hand, it is to analyse the predictive ability of the proposed model within a 
parametric probabilistic forecasting framework.
bounded in the sense that it can be between a minimum production, which is zero and a maximum production, which is the nominal capacity. 
This second value is related either to the wind turbine or wind farm or to the energy portfolio considered, therefore depending to your 
framework. Here, the nominal capacity represents the maximum production of the wind farm at Galicia. To formalize this feature the wind 
power measurements and forecasts are normalized by the nominal capacity, which is denoted by ùëÉ!, and then the outputs take values in the 
5 unit interval [0, 1]. Moreover, we note that the wind power generation is a nonlinear function of the wind speed, in the form of a 
sigmoid according to Pinson (2012). As a result, these characteristics show that the predictive densities in this case cannot be Gaussian 
for any temporal resolution of wind power time-series or whatever the forecast horizon considered.
The observations applied to this study come from the website of the Sotavento Galicia Foundation, which manages the Galicia wind farm site 
located in the northwest Spain. This wind farm has a nominal capacity of 17.56 megawatts (MW). An important remark is that Galicia is not a
purely commercial wind farm, but above all an experimental site. During the analysis of data, we have noted that the nominal capacity was 
never reached. Galicia being a training area then, this is one of the possible reasons why it does not maximize its power generation on its
wind farm. For this reason, the nominal capacity has been deliberately reduced to 13.56 MW. This considers the highest 20% measures as the 
nominal capacity. This assumption brings us closer to the industrial reality, which seeks to maximize the power generation i.e. the nominal
capacity is reached on regular basis. Obviously, this assumption doesn‚Äôt impact the aim of this study. The data processing was carried out 
with a personal implementation in Python. The measurements have been gathered for the period ranging from 1th January 2016 to 31th December
2016, consisting of 52703 data points. Some few data were dropped due to measurements errors. After the cleaning procedure, the data set 
for wind power generation in Galicia consists of 52123 valid data points.
