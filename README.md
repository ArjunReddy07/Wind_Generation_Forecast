## Master_Thesis_ZAETTA_Paul.pdf

It contains the master thesis which is "Very short-term analysis of wind power generation in a probabilistic forecasting framework". 

## Data_2016.xlsx

It contains the final data set. It has been previously cleaned using python (see the python script). The data set for wind power
generation in Galicia consists of 52123 valid data points (from 1th January 2016 to 31th December 2016).

## Cross_Validation_code_Matlab

It contains all the code (Matlab) to use the cross validation method for adjusting and calculating predictions to estimate the performance of the prediction model. More precisely, it helps us to determine the optimal parameters of the models. 

## MAE_RMSE_code_Matlab

It contains all the code (Matlab) to use the Mean Average Error and Root Mean Square Error methods. They allow us to evaluate the point forecasts by measuring differences between observed and predicted values.

## CRPS_code_Matlab

It contains all the code (Matlab) to use the Continuous Rank Probability Score. It is a verification tool related to probabilistic forecast systems, and it is a quantity that highlights to both forecast sharpness and calibration.
