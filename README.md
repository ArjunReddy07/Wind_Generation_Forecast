# Very short-term analysis of wind power generation in a probabilistic forecasting framework 

This is a Master thesis in time-series analysis as part of the study program in Economics and Finance at the University of Caâ€™ Foscari 
in Venice. This Master thesis is achieved within the framework of the double degree in Economics, Econometrics and Finance (MEEF) 
resulting from a partnership between the University of Venice and Aix-Marseille School of Economics. The thesis was carried out from April
to mid June of 2018. The Master thesis assumes the reader is familiar with notions and common methods within statistics.

## Abstract
Nowadays, generating very-short term energy power forecasts is a crucial challenge. In particular, wind generation, which exhibits large
fluctuations, is not easy to predict. This study is based on a probabilistic forecasting framework and ought to account for the nonlinear
and double-bounded nature of that stochastic process. Discrete and continuous mixtures of generalised logit-Normal distributions and
probability masses at the bounds serve to provide probabilistic forecasts. `Pinson (2012)` showed that this framework is superior to
classical models for wind power production, which assume that the shape of predictive densities follow (censored) Normal and Beta
distributions. Both simple autoregressive and autoregressive moving average models are designed in order to estimate the location and the
scale parameters. The first aim of this study is to extend the `Pinson (2012)` model by introducing a dynamic structure for the location of
the wind generation. The second aim is to analyse the predictive ability of the proposed model. The theory approach concerning the
different methods is illustrated by assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind generation at Galicia in the Spain Northwest
(on 10-minute ahead point).
